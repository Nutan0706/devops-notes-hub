2. How can you reference attributes from one aws resource within another resource configuration.?
3. How do you handle the creation of dependent resources such as ec2 instance that required a security group and subnet.?
4. How do you use the provisioner block within a resource block for AWS resources.?
5. How do you handle potential changes in aws resources config over time without cauing disruption.?
6. Explain how terraform handles rolling updates or replacement of AWS resources with minimal downtime.?

---

## 8. Terraform Modules
1. what is difference between calling a module with and without explict versioning.?
2. Explain how terraform manages state files when using modules.?
3. can you use community contributed modules in your terraform project and what precautions should you take.?

---

## 9. Local vs Remote State

---

## 10. State Locking

---

## 11. State File Structure

---

## 12. Input Variable

---

## 13. Output
1. How can you reference an output value in another terraform configuration.?
2. how can you access nested output values.?
3. how can you test the corretness of an output value in tf.?

---

## 14. Variable Files (.tfvars)

- `.tfvars` files are used to define variable values separately from the main configuration.  
- They help manage different environments (like dev, test, prod) easily.  
- You can pass them while running commands using:  
  ```bash
  terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"

---

## 22. Debugging Terraform Configurations

---

## 23. Common Errors and Solutions

---

## 24. Dynamic Blocks and Expressions

---

## 25. Data Sources
1. Fix existing infra
2. dynamic config
3. avoid hardcoding
4. enables dependencies
5. how do you handle data source errors such as when the requested resource is not found.?
6. how do you prevent unnessessary data source fetch to optimize peformance
7. how can you handle situation where data sources require complex fileing or quaries.?

---

## 27. Using Terraform with CI/CD Pipelines

---
## 28.üè∑Ô∏è Tags in Terraform

- **Tags** are key-value pairs used to organize and identify resources.  
- Help in **cost tracking**, **management**, and **automation**.  
- Can be added inside resource blocks like this:  
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-123456"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
      Name    = "MyServer"
      Project = "DemoApp"
      Env     = "Dev"
    }
  }

---
## 29. Terraform File Types

- **.tf** ‚Äì Main config files with resources, variables, and outputs.  
- **.tf.json** ‚Äì Same as `.tf` but written in JSON format.  
- **.tfvars** ‚Äì Stores variable values separately for different environments.  
- **.tftest.hcl / .tftest.json** ‚Äì Used for writing Terraform tests.  
- **.terraform.lock.hcl** ‚Äì Locks provider versions for consistent setups.  
- **.tfstate** ‚Äì Tracks the current state of your infrastructure.  
- **.tfstate.backup** ‚Äì Backup of the state file before changes.
