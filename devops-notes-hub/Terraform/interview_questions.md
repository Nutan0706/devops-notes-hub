# üåç Terraform Interview Questions & Notes

---

## 1. Benefits of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
1. **Consistent Setup** ‚Äì Same environment every time, no manual errors.  
2. **Faster Deployment** ‚Äì Automates setup and saves time.  
3. **Easy Tracking** ‚Äì Version control with Git for quick updates and rollbacks.

## 2. Terraform vs Other IaC Tools
1. **Multi-Cloud Support** ‚Äì Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and many more.  
2. **Declarative Language** ‚Äì Uses simple HCL syntax to define desired state.  
3. **Large Community** ‚Äì Huge ecosystem with many providers and modules.


## 3. Providers
1. purpose of the provider block in tf with AWS.?
2. can you use multiple AWS provider block in a single configuration.?
3. How you handles AWS credentials when using AWS provider in terraform.?
4. what happen if you don't specify the region in the AWS provider.?
5. can you use an IAM role instead of AWS access and secret key when configurating the AWS provider.?
6. How do you upgrade the AWS provider to a newer version in tf.?
7. can you override the AWS provider region for specific resource.?
8. how can you handle version constraints for the AWS provider in your terraform project.?
9. How can you test validity of AWS provider config without applying changes.?
10. How can you handle AWS provider authentication for a terraform module used by multiple team.?
11. How can you view the current version of the AWS provider used in terraform configuration.?
12. How does terraform handle AWS provider plugin updates.?
13. can you import existing AWS resources into terraform using the AWS provider.?

## 4. Variables
1. Explain how variable validation work in terraform.?
2. what is the purpose of locals in terraform and how can they be used with variables.?

4. How do you use the provisioner block within a resource block for AWS resources.?
5. How do you handle potential changes in aws resources config over time without cauing disruption.?
6. Explain how terraform handles rolling updates or replacement of AWS resources with minimal downtime.?
