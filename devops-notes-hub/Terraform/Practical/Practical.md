## ðŸ§© Terraform Practical Learning Roadmap

A complete hands-on roadmap to master Terraform â€” divided into **Beginner**, **Moderate**, and **Advanced** levels for real-world DevOps engineers.  
Each task builds progressively from **basic infrastructure** to **enterprise-grade automation**.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level (Core Foundations)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Install & Configure Terraform** | Setup CLI, provider plugins, and verify installation. |
| 2 | **Create EC2 Instance** | Use `aws_instance`, key pairs, and security group basics. |
| 3 | **Use Variables & Outputs** | Define input variables and output values for flexibility. |
| 4 | **Define Provider Block** | Configure AWS provider with region and credentials. |
| 5 | **Create S3 Bucket** | Manage object storage resources using Terraform. |
| 6 | **Create Security Group** | Allow SSH/HTTP traffic using ingress and egress rules. |
| 7 | **Use Terraform State Commands** | Learn about `terraform state list`, `show`, `rm`, etc. |
| 8 | **Use tfvars File for Different Environments** | Manage environment-based configurations (dev/prod). |
| 9 | **Create EBS Volume & Attach to EC2** | Practice storage management and resource linking. |
| 10 | **Use Data Sources** | Fetch existing resources like AMI, VPC, or subnets. |
| 11 | **Output Resource Information** | Display public IP or bucket name using outputs. |
| 12 | **Destroy Resources Safely** | Use `terraform destroy` and understand dependencies. |
| 13 | **Terraform Format & Validate** | Use `fmt` and `validate` for syntax and structure checks. |
| 14 | **Resource Tagging** | Add `tags` for environment and cost tracking. |
| 15 | **Version Locking for Providers** | Use `required_providers` and `required_version` blocks. |

### ðŸŸ  Moderate Level (Infrastructure Automation)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Build a Custom VPC with Subnets** | Create private/public subnets, route tables, and IGW. |
| 2 | **Deploy Multi-Tier Architecture** | Automate 3-tier setup (VPC + EC2 + RDS). |
| 3 | **Remote State Storage in S3 with DynamoDB Locking** | Enable collaboration and prevent state corruption. |
| 4 | **Use Terraform Modules** | Create reusable components for EC2, VPC, etc. |
| 5 | **Manage IAM Roles & Policies** | Create and attach IAM roles to instances. |
| 6 | **Attach Elastic IP to EC2** | Manage static IP resources programmatically. |
| 7 | **Use Locals & Conditionals** | Simplify complex logic using local variables. |
| 8 | **Integrate Terraform with Jenkins** | Automate plan & apply using CI/CD pipeline. |
| 9 | **Deploy Auto Scaling Group & Load Balancer** | Use `aws_autoscaling_group` and `aws_lb` resources. |
| 10 | **Manage Route53 DNS Records** | Automate domain and subdomain setups. |
| 11 | **Use Count & For_each Meta-Arguments** | Dynamically create multiple resources efficiently. |
| 12 | **Deploy RDS Instance Securely** | Create DB subnet groups, parameter groups, and secrets. |
| 13 | **Use Terraform Import Command** | Import existing AWS resources into Terraform management. |
| 14 | **Manage Multiple Environments Using Workspaces** | Use `terraform workspace` for dev, stage, prod. |
| 15 | **Implement Secrets Management with AWS Secrets Manager** | Securely inject secrets during apply. |

### ðŸ”´ Advanced Level (Enterprise & Scalable Infrastructure)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Deploy Kubernetes Cluster (EKS)** | Automate AWS EKS setup with node groups. |
| 2 | **Integrate Terraform with Terragrunt** | Manage large-scale infra with DRY configuration. |
| 3 | **Manage Multi-Account AWS Setup** | Use multiple provider aliases for account segregation. |
| 4 | **Automate Infrastructure Using Terraform Cloud** | Store remote state and manage team workspaces. |
| 5 | **Policy as Code with Sentinel (Terraform Enterprise)** | Enforce compliance using Sentinel policies. |
| 6 | **Build Multi-Region Deployment** | Replicate infrastructure across AWS regions. |
| 7 | **Integrate Terraform with GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline using GitHub workflows. |
| 8 | **Automated AMI Creation with Packer + Terraform** | Build immutable infra images and deploy. |
| 9 | **Use Dynamic Blocks and Complex Expressions** | Handle variable-length configurations dynamically. |
| 10 | **Create Private ECR & Deploy ECS Cluster** | Manage containerized workloads using Terraform. |
| 11 | **Integrate Terraform with Ansible** | Combine configuration and provisioning automation. |
| 12 | **Terraform Testing with Terratest** | Write Go tests to validate Terraform infrastructure. |
| 13 | **Manage Cross-Cloud Deployments (AWS + GCP + Azure)** | Use multiple providers in a single setup. |
| 14 | **Implement Blue-Green Deployment Strategy** | Manage zero-downtime infra updates. |
| 15 | **Cost Estimation and Drift Detection with Infracost & Terraform Cloud** | Monitor cost impact and detect drift automatically. |
