## ⚙️ **Intermediate-Level Questions**

These require slightly more thinking — often involving multiple passes or extra space.

1. Find the **missing number** in an array of `n` consecutive numbers.
2. Find **duplicates** in an array.
3. Find the **intersection** of two arrays.
4. Find the **union** of two arrays.
5. Find all pairs in an array that sum up to a **given value (target sum)**.
6. Implement **Kadane’s Algorithm** to find the maximum subarray sum.
7. Find the **majority element** (element appearing more than `n/2` times).
8. **Sort** an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s without using sorting algorithms (Dutch National Flag problem).
9. Merge two **sorted arrays** without using extra space.
10. Find the **first repeating** and **first non-repeating** element in an array.

## 🧠 **Advanced-Level Questions**

These involve optimization, divide and conquer, or advanced problem-solving patterns.

1. Find the **subarray with a given sum** (positive numbers).
2. Find the **longest subarray** with a sum equal to `k`.
3. Find the **longest consecutive sequence** in an unsorted array.
4. Find the **smallest subarray** with a sum greater than or equal to a target value.
5. Rearrange the array in **alternating positive and negative** numbers.
6. Find the **product of array elements except self** (without using division).
7. Find the **maximum product subarray**.
8. **Search an element in a rotated sorted array**.
9. Find the **median of two sorted arrays**.
10. Find the **next permutation** of a given array of numbers.
