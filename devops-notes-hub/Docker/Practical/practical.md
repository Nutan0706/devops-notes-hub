## ðŸ§© 6. Docker Practical Learning Roadmap

A full hands-on roadmap to master **Docker** â€” from container basics to production-grade orchestration.  
Divided into **Beginner**, **Moderate**, and **Advanced** levels for progressive real-world learning.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level (Core Foundations)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Install Docker on Linux/Windows** | Setup Docker Engine, CLI, and Docker Desktop. |
| 2 | **Run Your First Container (`hello-world`)** | Verify installation and understand container lifecycle. |
| 3 | **Pull and Run Images from Docker Hub** | Use `docker pull`, `docker run`, and `docker ps`. |
| 4 | **Build Custom Docker Image** | Write a simple `Dockerfile` and build with `docker build`. |
| 5 | **Inspect Running Containers** | Use `docker inspect`, `logs`, and `exec` commands. |
| 6 | **Manage Images and Containers** | Start, stop, remove, and list containers/images. |
| 7 | **Expose Ports and Access Containers** | Map host ports using `-p` flag in Docker run. |
| 8 | **Use Volumes for Data Persistence** | Create and mount volumes using `-v` option. |
| 9 | **Understand Dockerfile Instructions** | Learn `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc. |
| 10 | **Tag and Push Image to Docker Hub** | Use `docker tag` and `docker push` for image publishing. |
| 11 | **Run Multiple Containers Simultaneously** | Manage multiple services manually using CLI. |
| 12 | **Environment Variables in Containers** | Use `-e` flag and `.env` files. |
| 13 | **Inspect Container Networking** | Use `docker network ls` and `docker network inspect`. |
| 14 | **Difference Between CMD & ENTRYPOINT** | Understand container command execution behavior. |
| 15 | **Clean Up Docker Resources** | Use `docker system prune` and remove unused resources. |

---

### ðŸŸ  Moderate Level (Automation & Real-World Use)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Dockerize a Simple Python/NodeJS App** | Create app-specific Dockerfiles and run containers. |
| 2 | **Create Custom Bridge Network** | Connect multiple containers for inter-service communication. |
| 3 | **Use Bind Mounts for Local Development** | Sync code changes in real time. |
| 4 | **Use Multi-Stage Builds** | Optimize Docker image size and build performance. |
| 5 | **Create and Use Docker Compose File** | Manage multi-container setups (`web + db`). |
| 6 | **Setup a MySQL + WordPress Stack** | Deploy CMS using Docker Compose. |
| 7 | **Use `.dockerignore` File** | Exclude unnecessary files during build. |
| 8 | **Pass Secrets and Configs Securely** | Use environment files or Docker secrets. |
| 9 | **Manage Resource Limits** | Limit CPU/memory usage with `--memory` and `--cpus`. |
| 10 | **Docker Logs & Debugging** | Explore `docker logs`, `stats`, and troubleshooting. |
| 11 | **Link Containers Using Networks** | Set up backendâ€“frontend communication. |
| 12 | **Push Image to Private Registry** | Use self-hosted registry or AWS ECR. |
| 13 | **Use Docker Compose for Environment Variables** | Simplify app config using `.env` in Compose. |
| 14 | **Docker Health Checks** | Add health check instructions in Dockerfile. |
| 15 | **Build CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins + Docker** | Automate image build and push on commit. |

---

### ðŸ”´ Advanced Level (Enterprise & Cloud Integration)

| No. | Practical Task | Key Focus / Concept |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Deploy Containers on AWS ECS / Fargate** | Run Dockerized apps in serverless mode. |
| 2 | **Integrate Docker with Kubernetes (EKS/MiniKube)** | Deploy and manage containers using K8s. |
| 3 | **Build and Push Image Using Jenkins Pipeline** | Automate Docker build/push workflows. |
| 4 | **Use Docker Swarm Mode** | Learn native orchestration, scaling, and load balancing. |
| 5 | **Secure Docker Daemon & API** | Enable TLS, manage user permissions. |
| 6 | **Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions + Docker** | Build and deploy apps automatically on push. |
| 7 | **Monitor Docker with Prometheus & Grafana** | Collect and visualize container metrics. |
| 8 | **Use Docker Secrets and Configs in Swarm** | Manage sensitive data in production. |
| 9 | **Optimize Docker Images (Slim Builds)** | Use Alpine images, layer caching, and multi-stage builds. |
| 10 | **Build Custom Base Image for Organization** | Standardize builds with org-level base image. |
| 11 | **Docker Security Scanning** | Scan vulnerabilities using `docker scan` or Trivy. |
| 12 | **Implement Blue-Green Deployment with Docker Compose** | Zero downtime updates with staged rollouts. |
| 13 | **Integrate Docker with Terraform** | Automate container infrastructure provisioning. |
| 14 | **Set Up Private Docker Registry with Authentication** | Secure and manage internal images. |
| 15 | **Container Orchestration on Cloud (EKS/GKE/AKS)** | Manage Dockerized workloads at scale with Kubernetes. |

ðŸ§  **Pro Tip:**  
- Spend **10â€“15 days** on Beginner tasks to master Docker fundamentals.  
- **20 days** on Moderate tasks for automation and app-level deployments.  
- **25 days** on Advanced tasks to handle production-grade containers and orchestration.  

By the end, youâ€™ll have complete control over **Dockerized applications**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **cloud-native deployments** â€” just like a senior DevOps engineer. ðŸš€
