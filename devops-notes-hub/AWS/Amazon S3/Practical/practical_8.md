# üß† AWS S3 ‚Äî Use S3 with AWS CLI Sync

---

## üéØ Objective
Efficiently **sync a local folder with an S3 bucket** using the AWS CLI, enabling seamless backup and synchronization between local files and cloud storage.

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a Local Folder with Sample Files
Create a folder on your local machine to test the sync command.

```bash
mkdir local-backup
cd local-backup
echo "This is file1.txt" > file1.txt
echo "This is file2.txt" > file2.txt
```
<!-- Add snapshot here -->
üí° Tip: Keep your test files small while experimenting to avoid unnecessary data transfer costs.

---

### Step 2: Create or Identify an Existing S3 Bucket
If you don‚Äôt already have a bucket, create one using AWS CLI.
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-devops-sync-bucket --region ap-south-1
```
<!-- Add snapshot here -->
‚úÖ Note: Replace my-devops-sync-bucket with your own unique bucket name.

---

### Step 3: Sync Local Folder to S3 Bucket
Use the aws s3 sync command to upload (sync) all files from your local folder to the S3 bucket.
``` bash 
aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/
```
This command:
   Uploads new files that don‚Äôt exist in the bucket
   Updates changed files
   Skips unchanged files

üí° Tip: The sync command is ideal for incremental backups ‚Äî it only uploads modified or missing files.

---

###  Step 4: Verify the Synced Files
List the contents of your S3 bucket to confirm successful synchronization.
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/
```
Expected output:
```bash
2025-10-30 11:42:01     22 file1.txt
2025-10-30 11:42:01     22 file2.txt
```

---

### Step 5: Sync from S3 to Local (Download)
You can also reverse the direction ‚Äî sync your bucket contents back to your local folder.
```bash 
aws s3 sync s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/ ./local-restore
```

This will:
Download all files from the S3 bucket into a new folder named local-restore.
‚úÖ Note: Use this method for restoring backups from S3 to your system.

---

### Step 6: Use Sync with Deletion
If you want your bucket and local folder to mirror each other exactly, use the --delete flag.
This removes files from the destination that no longer exist in the source.
```bash 
aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/ --delete
```
<!-- Add snapshot here -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The --delete option permanently deletes extra files from the destination ‚Äî use carefully!

---

### Step 7: Verify Differences Before Sync
To check what changes will occur before actually syncing, use the --dryrun flag.
```bash
aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/ --dryrun
```
This simulates the sync and shows which files would be copied or deleted.

üí° Tip: Always run --dryrun before large or critical sync operations to preview changes safely.

---

### Step 8: Add Filters for Specific Files or Extensions
You can include or exclude specific files during sync.
#### Example 1: Sync only .txt files
```bash
aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/ --exclude "*" --include "*.txt"
```
#### Example 2: Exclude log files
```bash
aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-devops-sync-bucket/ --exclude "*.log"
```
<!-- Add snapshot here -->

‚úÖ Note: Use multiple --exclude and --include options for advanced filtering.

| üõ†Ô∏è Action | üíª Command | üìù Description |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Upload Local ‚Üí S3** | `aws s3 sync ./local-backup s3://my-bucket/` | Upload and sync files |
| **Download S3 ‚Üí Local** | `aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket/ ./local-folder` | Restore backup locally |
| **Preview Sync** | `aws s3 sync ... --dryrun` | Simulate changes before execution |
