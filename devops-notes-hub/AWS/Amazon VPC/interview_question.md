<summary><h2>üß© 10 Scenario-Based VPC Questions (Real-World)</h2></summary>

> These are asked for 4+ years DevOps / Cloud Engineer roles.

**Scenario 1:**  
Your EC2 instance in a private subnet cannot reach the internet. How will you troubleshoot?  
*(Hint: Route table ‚Üí NAT ‚Üí SG ‚Üí NACL ‚Üí IGW in public subnet)*  

**Scenario 2:**  
Two VPCs (A & B) are peered. A can reach B, but B cannot reach A. Why?  
*(Hint: Routing + SG + NACL misconfig)*  

**Scenario 3:**  
You need to securely expose a service in your VPC to **only one customer‚Äôs VPC** in another account. What will you choose?  
*(Hint: PrivateLink)*  

**Scenario 4:**  
Your organisation has 10 VPCs and must connect them + on-prem. What solution is best and why?  
*(Hint: Transit Gateway)*  

**Scenario 5:**  
A Private Subnet EC2 needs to pull Docker images from ECR without internet. How?  
*(Hint: VPC Endpoint for ECR + S3)*  

**Scenario 6:**  
Traffic between two VPCs in different regions is slow. How to optimize?  
*(Hint: Inter-region VPC peering ‚Üí uses AWS backbone network)*  

**Scenario 7:**  
Your database in private subnet should only accept traffic from one application subnet. Describe configuration.  
*(Hint: SG rules + avoid wide NACL rules)*  

**Scenario 8:**  
How do you allow on-prem systems to securely connect to your VPC? Provide 3 architectures.  
*(Hint: VPN, DX, VPN + DX, TGW + DX)*  

**Scenario 9:**  
You need to give developers restricted access to only one subnet in VPC. How?  
*(Hint: IAM + SCP + NACL + SG + SSM Session Manager)*  

**Scenario 10:**  
Your NAT Gateway bill is too high. How do you reduce cost?  
**Possible solutions:**  
- Use **1 NAT per AZ only if required**  
- Use **S3 + DynamoDB VPC Endpoints**  
- **Proxy** or **split traffic**
