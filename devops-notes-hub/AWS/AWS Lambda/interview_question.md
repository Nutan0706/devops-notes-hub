## ðŸ§© Scenario-Based Questions (10)

<details>

| No. | Scenario |
|-----|------------|
| 1 | Your Lambda processing SQS messages is failing randomly. How will you handle retries & failures? |
| 2 | You have a Lambda that takes 20 minutes to process a task, but Lambda max timeout is 15 mins. How will you solve this? |
| 3 | Lambda is invoked frequently and causing high cold starts. Whatâ€™s the best solution? |
| 4 | You want to deploy Lambda code to Prod without downtime. How? |
| 5 | Lambda processing large files (2GB+) from S3 is failing due to memory/time limits. Whatâ€™s your approach? |
| 6 | Your Lambda needs to connect to an RDS DB inside a VPC but execution is slow. What should you optimize? |
| 7 | You need to maintain state across multiple Lambda executions. How will you design it? |
| 8 | Your Lambda is triggered twice for every S3 event. How do you prevent duplicate processing? |
| 9 | You need real-time processing of millions of events per minute. Would you use Lambda or something else? Why? |
| 10 | A Lambda interacting with DynamoDB faces throttling errors. How do you fix & optimize throughput? |
