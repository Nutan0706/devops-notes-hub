# 🧠 AWS Lambda Practical Learning — For 5 Years Experienced DevOps Engineer

---

## 🟢 Beginner Level (Fundamentals)

| # | Practical Task | Description |
|---|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Create Your First Lambda Function** | Create a simple “Hello World” function using the AWS Console. |
| 2 | **Configure Lambda Execution Role (IAM Role)** | Assign minimal IAM permissions (e.g., write logs to CloudWatch). |
| 3 | **Test Lambda Function via Console** | Run the function using test events and observe logs in CloudWatch. |
| 4 | **Set Environment Variables** | Use key-value pairs to manage runtime configurations securely. |
| 5 | **Use Layers in Lambda** | Add shared dependencies (e.g., boto3, pandas) using Lambda Layers. |

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Level (Real-World Scenarios)

| # | Practical Task | Description |
|---|----------------|-------------|
| 6 | **Trigger Lambda from S3 Event** | Automatically invoke Lambda when a file is uploaded to a specific S3 bucket. |
| 7 | **Trigger Lambda from API Gateway** | Build a simple REST API using API Gateway → Lambda integration. |
| 8 | **Integrate Lambda with DynamoDB** | Perform CRUD operations on a DynamoDB table from Lambda. |
| 9 | **Use Parameter Store / Secrets Manager** | Fetch sensitive data like DB credentials securely within the function. |
| 10 | **Implement Lambda Versioning & Aliases** | Manage multiple versions (Dev, Prod) using aliases for safe deployments. |

---

## 🔴 Advanced Level (Enterprise & Automation)

| # | Practical Task | Description |
|---|----------------|-------------|
| 11 | **Deploy Lambda using Terraform / CloudFormation** | Automate Lambda deployment, IAM role, and triggers using IaC tools. |
| 12 | **Implement VPC-Connected Lambda** | Run Lambda inside a VPC to access private resources (e.g., RDS). |
| 13 | **Use EventBridge / SQS / SNS as Triggers** | Build event-driven architectures using Lambda and AWS messaging services. |
| 14 | **Monitor Lambda Performance** | Use CloudWatch metrics, logs, and X-Ray for tracing and debugging. |
| 15 | **Optimize Lambda Cost & Performance** | Tune memory size, runtime, and cold start handling using Provisioned Concurrency. |

## ✅ Bonus Practical Tasks for DevOps Engineers

- Integrate **Lambda with CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)** for automated deployments.  
- Use **Lambda for automation** — rotate IAM access keys, clean up S3 buckets, or back up DynamoDB tables.  
- Build a **serverless notification system** (SNS → Lambda → Slack).  
- Manage **Lambda code with SAM CLI or Serverless Framework** for enterprise-level workflows.  
- Enforce compliance using **AWS Config rules** to check Lambda configuration best practices.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:**  
> Always apply the **Principle of Least Privilege** to Lambda IAM roles, monitor execution with CloudWatch and X-Ray, and automate deployments with Terraform or the Serverless Framework for better scalability and maintainability.
